The image dataset contains images of lego bricks generated on computers for different angles. 
The aim of the project is to classify those images. There are actually 16 categories present in the dataset. 
The model was created using Convolution networks on Keras. I tried applying various regularizers like dropout, ridge regression, Data augmentation etc..
Lets see the effect on them!
